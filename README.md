# Synopsis
"Attention Informer" is a app that discover claims in twitters using automated analytics powered by Insights for Twitter and the Natural Language Classifier(NLC) on IBM Bluemix. 
The app is able to detect the negative tweets and judge grammatical homophone correctly.

This time I created a app that are able to be used in the cell phone companies in America.
We would like to pick up the word of Sprint as a cell phone company without meaning of dash, rush and etc.

If the ratio of negative tweets is over X %. it informs appropriate department with alrms by telephone system created by twilio. NLC is also used which department is adequate to attend to inquiries and complaints.

You can see a preview of this app in action and a brieft walkthrough of the code in the following video preview.
